### How do I report a bug?
To report a bug you will need a Github account. After you sign up or sign in, go to the "Issues" at the top, then select "New issue" and use the "Bug Report" template to submit your bug.

### How do I know if my bug is already being tracked?
Go to the "Issues" tab and use the search bar at the top to search for bug currently being tracked.

### How do I request a feature?
Similar to reporting a bug, go to the "Issues" tab at the top, then select "New issue" and use the "Feature Request" template to submit your feature request.

### How do I know if my feature has already been requested?
Similiar to searching for a bug, go to the "Issues" tab and use the search bar at the top to search for the feature requests currently being tracked.

### Do I really have to sign up for an account?
Yes. Github is an awesome tool that helps developers like me to keep track of everything in a single place. Otherwise, I would have to write down everything in paper.
